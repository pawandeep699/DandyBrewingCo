        Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business. 
        The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their separate ways.<br>
         They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion. <br>
        
        In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing industry in Alberta,<br>
        allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been<br>
        growing their home-brew experience, not only in size but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning,<br>
         and many batches, they began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse.<br><br><br>
        
        While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer flooding into Alberta. Much of<br>
        their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of them,<br>
         the topic of starting something amazing often came up over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure<br>
          it was possible under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible.<br><br><br> 
        
        Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to was that the brewery<br>
        would have to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box for breweries in the province. Exciting beer<br>
        styles, quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production.<br><br><br>  
        
        Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his return to Calgary, and with<br>
        a new found interest in brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with an old high school friend. A home brew batch later, and a<br>
        discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the group. He was a much needed addition bringing expertise in laboratory process<br>
         and a deep understanding of the science behind the beer.<br><br><br> 
        
        When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out the final details for The<br>
        Dandy Brewing Company.<br><br><br> 
        
        In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June 2014 the brewhouse was<br>
        built. August 2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the shelves. April 2015 the first draught accounts started<br>
        pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened. January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was completed.<br><br><br>
        
        April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room, a new production facility and full service<br>
        tasting room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking food. Dandy beers. Cocktails. wine. The full Dandy<br>
        experience.<br><br><br> 
        
        This story is just beginning.<br>
